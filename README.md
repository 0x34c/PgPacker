# PgPacker
Simple packer coded in C++ and C#, which uses RunPE.</br>
Code is well commented, though, if I didn't understand it correctly, or if I just missed something, you can create new pull request.
# Usage
Stub compiled as x64 obviously doesn't work with x86 files, and vice versa.</br>
So, only thing you have to do is changing the platform between x64 and x86 before compiling. The files will be compiled in `build` folder.
# Known issues
The code doesnt have any imports rebuilding</br>
The code doesn't work for .NET files
